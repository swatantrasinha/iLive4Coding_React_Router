In this section we will see how to capture Query Parameters
but this is not complete as I am not able to deisgn Header Navbar
with dropdown as in video

Here I have tried to create => "MyCustomDropDown"
But it has not served the purpose ...


it seems material ui is being used in video so I have done that in next => "05b_React_Router"
